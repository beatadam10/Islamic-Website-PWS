            <h2>What is Islam?</h2>
            <p>
                Islam is a way of life. It is a religion of peace, compassion, and submission to the will of the one true God, Allah. 
                Through its teachings, Islam provides guidance for every aspect of lifeâ€”spiritual, moral, and social. At its core, 
                Islam emphasizes monotheism, justice, and the dignity of all human beings.

            <h2>Core Teachings of Islam</h2>
            <p>
                The teachings of Islam are rooted in the belief in the oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and the guidance provided by 
                the Quran, the holy book of Muslims, and the Sunnah, the practices of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faith (Iman):</strong> A Muslim must believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Day of Judgment, and destiny.</li>
                <li><strong>Five Pillars:</strong> Shahada (faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage).</li>

            <h2>Islam: A Religion of Peace</h2>
            <p>
                The word "Islam" comes from the Arabic root word "Salaam," meaning peace. At its heart, Islam aims to 
                establish peace within oneself and across societies. The Quran teaches that taking an innocent life 
                is like killing all of humanity, while saving one is akin to saving all of humanity (Quran 5:32).

            <h2>Addressing Misconceptions</h2>
            <p>
                Islam is often misunderstood due to misinformation or isolated incidents that do not reflect its true principles. 
                For example, jihad refers to personal struggle, not violence.
